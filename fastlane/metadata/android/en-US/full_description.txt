<p><i>BatteryTile</i> is an Android Quick Settings tile that displays the current battery state and percentage, and a long-press action to open the battery settings.</p><p>The "Battery Saver" tile in Android 12 in below, when long-pressed, would open the battery settings page in Android Settings. With the introduction of Android 13, it no longer presents the battery settings page. Instead, it now opens the Battery Saver settings, removing this very useful shortcut. This app aims to restore said functionality with a custom Quick Settings tile.</p>
